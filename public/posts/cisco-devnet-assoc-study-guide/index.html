<p>Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved so that the tests pass. This is opposed to software development that allows software to be added that is not proven to meet requirements. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Wikipedia Link</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ideology of Test-driven development is that you write tests before you write code. The primary goal is to ensure that the vast majority of your code works the way that it should &ndash; and that any changes to one part of your code do not have consequences to other parts of your code you don&rsquo;t catch immediately. Inevitably something you didn&rsquo;t account for will end up failing. When it does, you write a test that covers that case so it doesn&rsquo;t happen again. And the cycle continues.</p>

<h3 id="14-compare-software-development-methods-agile-lean-waterfall">1.4 Compare software development methods (agile, lean, waterfall)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Agile:
<ul>
<li>Flexibility focused.</li>
<li>Allows for evolution of the product as it is being worked on</li>
<li>Work is performed in short planned phases (i.e. every 2-3 weeks)
<ul>
<li>The goal of each iteration to provide a working product.</li>
<li>Tests must pass at the end of each cycle</li>
<li>Stakeholders get updated at the end of each cycle and may provide feedback
<ul>
<li>Changes may be incorporated from feedback in the next phase</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Downside: The openness to change may result in fluxuating timelines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Waterfall:
<ul>
<li>Development doesn&rsquo;t start until all planning is done</li>
<li>Sequential and Linear development cycle</li>
<li>Longer development cycles between producing updates</li>
<li>Inflexible &ndash; Very hard to make changes in the middle of a dev cycle</li>
<li>Lacks visibility. I.e. fewer check-ins / updates</li>
<li>Upside: Since scope is known ahead of time:
<ul>
<li>Timelines tend to be more stable</li>
<li>Progress is more easily measured against an end goal</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lean
<ul>
<li>Focused on producing an MVP as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>Can &ldquo;fail fast&rdquo; from a business perspective.
<ul>
<li>i.e. Are you building the right product? Allows you to abandon early if you aren&rsquo;t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduce project delivery time and cost while delivering to a specific set of minimum requirements</li>
<li>Downside: Little effort and time is spent considering the future needs of the application.</li>

</code></pre></div><p>This time instead of repeating the same structure of code to produce a full name, we extracted it into a function. A piece of code that we can reuse over and over again to produce the same result. And if something needs to be changed we only need to change it in one place. Not 2 or more.</p>
<p>But there is still some improvement to be had here. For instance, what happens if we sent in an object that didn&rsquo;t have a firstName and a lastName? It would break. That&rsquo;s an extremely fragile piece of code. Lets see what a class can do for us here:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Ahhh&hellip; Now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere. We have a class named person with a constructor that takes a firstName, a lastName, and an occupation. So if we were to do people[0] and put a period, we would get intellisense showing us options available on this type of object.</p>
<p>Then we moved our getFullName() function inside that class. So every person object now has a method to get the fullname of that person. MUCH cleaner! And reuseable! And testable! We only have to test whether the Person class and its methods work correctly. If they don&rsquo;t we can fix it all in one place.</p>
<p>As far as modules go, they&rsquo;re more for separating classes, functions, and values into groups that make sense. i.e. you might make one module that handles logging, so you can import it into any other python file you&rsquo;re using. Or you might create a module that has all the methods for talking to an API. And then you could have a main python file that imports the API module and the logging module. And you&rsquo;d know exactly what each is for because the logic is separated based on responsibility.</p>
<h3 id="16-identify-the-advantages-of-common-design-patterns-mvc-and-observer">1.6 Identify the advantages of common design patterns (MVC and Observer)</h3>
<h4 id="mvc-or-model-view-controller">MVC or Model-View-Controller</h4>
<p>This is a pattern used in many languages &ndash; it is for the use of applications with a GUI.</p>
<ul>
<li>Model: Your data structures and potentially business logic. Though it may just be used to get data from a database.</li>
<li>View: What your user sees</li>
<li>Controller: The glue between your model and your view. It gets data from the model to be shown to the user, and sends data from the view to the model layer to be saved to databases etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the benefits of this pattern is the separation of responsibilities into logical layers. This makes it easier to organize, understand, and test your code.</p>
<h4 id="observer-pattern">Observer Pattern</h4>
<p>The simplest way I can think of to describe the observer pattern is: What if you had an editable table of data on a screen, and to the left of that data you had a chart based on that data. Every time you update the data in the table you&rsquo;d expect the graph to change right? That&rsquo;s exactly the kind of problem that the Observer pattern is a solution for.</p>
<p>It quite literally &ldquo;observes&rdquo; an object that other objects rely on. And when that object&rsquo;s state changes, the observer says &ldquo;Hey, you over there, this object you rely on just changed.&rdquo; Then those other objects can be update based on the object&rsquo;s new state.</p>
<h4 id="why-patterns">Why Patterns</h4>
<p>People have been programming for a long time. And it&rsquo;s very common for programmers to run into the same problems that other people have run into. It&rsquo;s the reason things like StackOverflow exist. Patterns were created to help remedy the most common &ldquo;big&rdquo; problems. So it&rsquo;s beneficial to learn common design patterns so that you can use proven solutions instead of banging your head against the wall trying to solve design issues on your own.</p>

<p>Alright, so what to do to get JSON? We need to change our Accept header to tell the API what kind of response we want back.</p>

<p>There is another endpoint that says:</p>

<h3 id="describe-common-usage-patterns-related-to-webhooks">Describe common usage patterns related to webhooks</h3>
<p>APIs are wonderful. You ask them for information, they give it to you. But what if that information changes all the time, and your application relies on up-to-date data?</p>
<p>Well, you just query it more often right? Maybe. But most APIs have a rate-limit. After a certain number of requests per second or minute they tell you &ldquo;Whoa, slow down.&rdquo; They do this by denying your request and usually sending a header along to tell you how long your timeout is for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I need the new data as soon as it changes!!&quot;, you say. In comes the webhook to save the day, IF the API you&rsquo;re working with has made them available.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on you asking for more information, you register a link to an API of your own that is capable of receiving a POST request. This tells the API you need information from &ndash; &ldquo;Hey, everytime this data changes <strong>YOU</strong> send <strong>ME</strong> an update!&quot;. When the data changes, the API sees your registered webhook and sends a POST request to your API with the new data. Voila! No more sending GET requests every 5 seconds to the API!</p>
<h3 id="identify-the-constraints-when-consuming-apis">Identify the constraints when consuming APIs</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what they&rsquo;re looking for here, but my guess is things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How often you can make a request of the API before it gives you back a 429 TooManyRequests response</li>
<li>What type of authentication is required to use the API</li>
<li>How many requests you can make in any given time period (day,week,month) before you hit your limit</li>

<p>We&rsquo;ll take a look at a slightly more &ldquo;professional&rdquo; API than ICanHazDadJoke this time around. Let&rsquo;s check out the <a href="https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/basics">Webex Teams API: Basics</a></p>
<p>Scroll down to the API Errors section. You should see a table like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Code</th>
<th>Status</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>200</td>
<td>OK</td>
<td>Successful Request</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>204</td>
<td>No Content</td>
<td>Successful request without body content</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>400</td>
<td>Bad Request</td>
<td>The request was invalid or cannot be otherwise served. An accompanying error message will explain further</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>401</td>
<td>Unauthorized</td>
<td>Authentication credentials were missing or incorrect</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Most APIs will have information like this to let you know what went wrong and how to handle it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you see an error message in the 50x range, you&rsquo;re all outta luck. Those are server issues and the only thing you can do is send a message to the owners of that API and hope they fix it.</p>

<h3 id="utilize-common-api-authentication-mechanisms-basic-custom-token-and-api-keys">Utilize common API authentication mechanisms: basic, custom token, and API keys</h3>
<p><strong>Most</strong> APIs have some sort of authentication, even if it&rsquo;s just to keep track of who is doing what so abusers can be caught. Not many are as open as the ICanHazDadJoke API, where its only request is that if you&rsquo;re using it from an application of your own (as opposed to just playing around with it) you put the application name in the User-Agent header so they can tell where it&rsquo;s coming from.</p>
<p>The most common form of this that I see is an API Key. You register for a service, agree to all the terms, and they give you an API key that is strictly for your account. You then put that in the header of every request you make. I.e. if ICanHazDadJoke did require an API key, the request might look like this:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>You also have Basic Authentication, Digest Authentication, and OAuth (1 and 2) Authentication.</p>
<p>Basic authentication is the simplest. And the least secure. You send the username and password over plain text. So if it&rsquo;s done, it really should be done using Transport Layer Security (TLS) &ndash; i.e. it should use https, not http. In Python it looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">requests<span style="color:#719e07">.</span>get(<span style="color:#2aa198"></span><span style="color:#2aa198">&#39;</span><span style="color:#2aa198">https://api.github.com/user</span><span style="color:#2aa198">&#39;</span>, auth<span style="color:#719e07">=</span>HTTPBasicAuth(<span style="color:#2aa198"></span><span style="color:#2aa198">&#39;</span><span style="color:#2aa198">user</span><span style="color:#2aa198">&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#2aa198"></span><span style="color:#2aa198">&#39;</span><span style="color:#2aa198">pass</span><span style="color:#2aa198">&#39;</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>Digest Authentication is very similar to Basic, except that it encrypts the data with a hash instead of sending it in plain text. So even though TLS is always preferred, in this case it&rsquo;s not as risky.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">requests<span style="color:#719e07">.</span>get(<span style="color:#2aa198"></span><span style="color:#2aa198">&#39;</span><span style="color:#2aa198">https://api.github.com/user</span><span style="color:#2aa198">&#39;</span>, auth<span style="color:#719e07">=</span>HTTPDigestAuth(<span style="color:#2aa198"></span><span style="color:#2aa198">&#39;</span><span style="color:#2aa198">user</span><span style="color:#2aa198">&#39;</span>, <span style="color:#2aa198"></span><span style="color:#2aa198">&#39;</span><span style="color:#2aa198">pass</span><span style="color:#2aa198">&#39;</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>OAuth is the most common form of authentication if you&rsquo;re authenticating on behalf of other users. Think of an app that you&rsquo;ve signed up for that was 3rd party for a large service. Or when you use a Facebook account to authenticate with a non-Facebook service. When you sign up, you&rsquo;ve probably seen a page that says &ldquo;This application would like to access your account with these privileges: Read your username, Read your email, etc&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s the Oauth workflow at work!</p>
<p>It basically goes like this:
Your app has a Client Id and probably a Client Secret, along with a redirect URI (where to go back to once a user has authenticated). You also specify a scope of rights your app should have.</p>
<p>Whenever a user wants to authenticate, you send them to the API services Oauth url with the parameters we talked about in the paragraph above. They will get a message like &ldquo;FooBarton&rsquo;s app would like to access your profile&rdquo;. If they click accept, their service uses the redirect URI to send them back to your page along with a special code. Your app then uses that code to make a <strong>second</strong> request to a different endpoint to get a token with that code. That token is then good for a set amount of time before it must be renewed or the user must re-authenticate.</p>

<h3 id="compare-common-api-styles-rest-rpc-synchronous-and-asynchronous">Compare common API styles (REST, RPC, synchronous, and asynchronous)</h3>
<h4 id="rest-and-rpc">REST and RPC</h4>
<p>REST, which has become the most popular form of communication with APIs has rules and standards that help making talking to any API a near-ubiquitous experience. If you&rsquo;ve done a GET with one REST API that returns JSON, you&rsquo;ve done them all. This allows an API to last for a very long time without needing to be changed.</p>
<p>Some of the restrictions REST API developers are supposed to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>REST must be stateless: not persisting sessions between requests.</li>
<li>Responses should declare cacheablility: helps your API scale if clients respect the rules.</li>
<li>REST focuses on uniformity: if you’re using HTTP you should utilize HTTP features whenever possible, instead of inventing conventions.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>See all 6 architectural constraints described <a href="https://restfulapi.net/rest-architectural-constraints/">here</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>REST APIs will commonly use all of the available HTTP verbs for a given endpoint to allow you to do CRUD-based (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH</p>
<p>And these can take data payloads in the form of JSON, or query parameters like we used previously to modify the request</p>
<p>RPC stands for &ldquo;Remote Procedure Call&rdquo;. Think of it like calling a python function. An RPC API is a list of functions available to call where you give it the name of the function and the argument/parameter for it. And these APIs typically only serve GET or POST requests.</p>
<p>One of the big differences is that, with RPC, <em>everything</em> is a separate function.</p>
<p>Say you have a person directory. If you want to get people by first name you might do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">POST /getPersonByFirstName

{&#34;firstName&#34;: &#34;Elliot&#34;}
</code></pre></div><p>But if you wanted to get people by last name:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">POST /getPersonByLastName

<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#93a1a1;background-color:#002b36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">GET /getPerson?lastName=Baker
GET /getPerson?firstName=Elliot
</code></pre></div><p>Same API endpoint, just with a different query parameter.</p>
<p>In this regard, REST is usually seen as the best way to deal with CRUD, while RPC is more action based.</p>
<p>Slack uses an RPC api because things like kick, ban, etc don&rsquo;t really fit well in the GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH semantics. In REST you expect that GET is for reading, POST is for adding new things, etc. Where do kick and ban fit in? You could make them, for sure. But when you start shoehorning REST with RPC-style actions, it gets a little confusing. Not just for developers, but for users who expect your REST API to act just like a REST API.</p>
<h4 id="synchronous-and-asynchronous">Synchronous and Asynchronous</h4>
<p>The easiest way to think of synchronous and asynchronous is that synchronous is synonomous with the wait symbol (hourlgass, spinner, etc). You know when you go to a website and it sits there with a spinner in the browser tab? That&rsquo;s a synchronous operation. You have to wait for it, and while you&rsquo;re waiting the app (or webpage) is stalled.</p>
<p>An asynchronous operation is one that you do not have to wait for directly. Let&rsquo;s say, for instance, that you make an RPC call to configure and deploy a new server. And that operation will take 10 minutes. Do you want your app to make that call and then sit there locked up for 10 minutes waiting for it to finish? (synch)</p>
<p>Or do you want to make that call and let a webhook notify you whenever it&rsquo;s done. And in the meantime your user is still able to use the app to look at other things. (async)</p>
<p>Or maybe you want to GET a list of all your transactions for the last 20 years. And this will take 30 minutes to complete. You could send a request to the API with your email address and it could send you an email with a link to your download when it&rsquo;s ready. But you didn&rsquo;t have to sit there waiting 30 minutes. You can go do other things. (async)</p>
<p>As with REST and RPC, Synchronous and Asynchronous APIs have their uses!</p>

<h4 id="meraki">Meraki</h4>
<p>The Meraki Dashboard API is an interface for software to interact directly with the Meraki cloud platform and Meraki managed devices. The API contains a set of tools known as endpoints for building software and applications that communicate with the Meraki Dashboard for use cases such as provisioning, bulk configuration changes, monitoring, and role-based access controls. The Dashboard API is a modern, RESTful API using HTTPS requests to a URL and JSON as a human-readable format. The Dashboard API is an open-ended tool can be used for many purposes, and here are some examples of how it is used today by Meraki customers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add new organizations, admins, networks, devices, VLANs, SSIDs</li>
<li>Provision thousands of new sites in minutes with an automation script</li>
<li>Automatically onboard and off-board new employees&rsquo; teleworker device</li>
<li>Build your own dashboard for store managers, field techs, or unique use cases</li>
</ul>
<p>Also leverage the Location Service APIs to discover real-time location statistics to improve customer engagement and loyalty across sites.</p>

<h4 id="cisco-dna-center">Cisco DNA Center</h4>
<p>Intent API (Northbound)
The Intent API is a Northbound REST API that exposes specific capabilities of the Cisco DNA Center platform. The Intent API provides policy-based abstraction of business intent, allowing focus on an outcome rather than struggling with individual mechanisms steps. The RESTful Cisco DNA Center Intent API uses HTTPS verbs (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) with JSON structures to discover and control the network. For more information, see Intent API. The Intent API is grouped, hierarchically into functional &lsquo;domains&rsquo; and &lsquo;subdomains&rsquo; of service.</p>

<h4 id="aci">ACI</h4>
<p>Cisco ACI Programmability with Object-Oriented Data Model and REST APIs
Cisco has taken a foundational approach to building a programmable network infrastructure with Cisco ACI. The ACI infrastructure operates as a single system at the fabric level, controlled by the centralized Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC). With this approach, the data center network as a whole is tied together cohesively and treated as an intelligent transport system for the applications that support business. On network devices that are part of this fabric, the operating systems have been written to support this system view and provide an architecture for programmability at the foundation.</p>
<p>Instead of opening up a subset of the network functionality through programmatic interfaces, like previous Software Defined Networking (SDN) solutions, the entire ACI infrastructure is opened up for programmatic access. This is achieved by providing access to Cisco ACI object model. The ACI object model represents the complete configuration and runtime state of every single software and hardware component in the entire infrastructure. The object model is made available through standard REST API interfaces, making it easy to access and manipulate the configuration and runtime state of the system.</p>

<h4 id="cisco-sd-wan">Cisco SD-WAN</h4>
<p>Legacy networking technology has become increasingly expensive and complex, and it cannot scale to meet the needs of today&rsquo;s multisite enterprises. The Cisco SD-WAN Secure Extensible Network (SEN), which is based on time-tested and proven elements of networking, offers an elegant, software-based solution that reduces the costs of running enterprise networks and provides straightforward tools to simplify the provisioning and management of large and complex networks that are distributed across multiple locations and geographies. Built in to the Cisco SD-WAN SEN are inherent authentication and security processes that ensure the safety and privacy of the network and its data traffic.</p>
<p>The Cisco SD-WAN SEN represents an evolution of networking from an older, hardware-based model to a secure, software-based, virtual IP fabric. The Cisco SD-WAN fabric, also called an overlay network, forms a software overlay that runs over standard network transport services, including the public Internet, MPLS, and broadband. The overlay network also supports next-generation software services, thereby accelerating your shift to cloud networking.</p>

<h4 id="ios-xe">IOS XE</h4>
<p><strong>NETCONF</strong> provides a means to programmatically interact with a device – in a model-based, machine-consumable, easy to understand and standards-based way. NETCONF is defined by &gt;RFC-6241 and is based on the YANG modeling language.</p>
<ul>
<li>NETCONF listens on any IP address assigned to the system. When enabled, NETCONF runs on port 830 and uses SSH for transport. SSH is enabled automatically when the NETCONF feature is enabled.</li>
<li>NETCONF connections should be authenticated using AAA credentials. RADIUS, TACACS+ or local users defined with privilege level 15 access are allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>RESTCONF</strong> is a YANG-based, REST-like interface for configuring and operating network devices. RESTCONF is defined by an RFC 8040. The structure of data exchanged using the RESTCONF interface is defined (in advance) using YANG models. Management systems using YANG can directly access managed resources in a single operation. Familiar REST operations are included with RESTCONF, like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>RESTCONF listens on any IP address assigned to the system. RESTCONF operates on port 443 when enabled, and uses HTTPS for transport.</li>
<li>RESTCONF connections should be authenticated using AAA credentials. RADIUS, TACACS+ or local users defined with privilege level 15 access are allowed.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="nx-os">NX-OS</h4>
<p>NETCONF and RESTCONF can both be used with NX-OS, but it brings an even better option to the table: NX-API</p>
<p><strong>NX-API REST</strong> brings Model Driven Programmability (MDP) to standalone (non-APIC-based fabric) Nexus family switches. In model-driven architectures, software maintains a complete, explicit representation of the administrative and operational state of the system (the model) and performs actions only as side-effects of mutations of model entities.</p>
<p>This model is a formal specification understood by network planners and developers that is rendered into a running system. Furthermore, this object model is made available through standard Representational State Transfer (REST) interfaces, making it easier to access and manipulate the object model, and hence, the configuration and runtime state of the system.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If a company website were hosted in Japan, for instance, people in the U.S. might experience delays when using it. But in an edge computing model, the company would have a server in the U.S. that it would direct U.S. people to instead. This is most commonly used in Content Delivery Networks where data is cached at the edge so users can download it faster.</p>

This can be for a number of reasons such as security, budgets, compliance, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Public Cloud</strong>: A Public Cloud is a third-party resource for purchasing compute, database, and other services that is publically available over the internet. One of the primary reasons made for using public clouds is the on-demand nature. Allowing a company or individual to pay for only what they need &ndash; or get rid of anything they don&rsquo;t &ndash; whenever they need to.</p>
<p><strong>Hybrid Cloud</strong>: A mix of both on-premises, private and public cloud infrastructure. A common use for this is cloud bursting, where a customer is able to get resources from the public cloud on demand when their on-premises resources have reached their limit. i.e. during times of high stress such as Black Friday sales. When the load returns to normal the public cloud resources are removed.</p>
<p><strong>Edge</strong>: Used to bring computing power and storage close to the source of the request</p>

<h4 id="43a-virtual-machines">4.3.a Virtual machines</h4>
<p>A virtualized operating system sitting on top of a hypervisor. Deployed in public and private clouds such as Microsoft Azure, AWS, and VMware. Many VMs are able to share the same hardware, making more efficient use of physical resources.</p>
<h4 id="43b-bare-metal">4.3.b Bare metal</h4>
<p>Installing an operating system directly on the hardware instead of using virtualization; the previously-traditional way that servers were provisioned. Nowadays this is primarily for legacy applications that cannot be virtualized, or for installing a hypervisor (such as VMware) on.</p>
<h4 id="43c-containers">4.3.c Containers</h4>
<p>A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. - <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">What is a Container</a></p>
<p>One benefit of a container is the ability to separate applications into their own &ldquo;contained&rdquo; environments. Which means you could update / redeploy one container without changing or affecting any other containers running on the same host.</p>
