      <description>1.0 Software Development and Design (15%) 1.1 Compare data formats (XML, JSON, YAML)   YAML (YAML Aint Markup Language)
 Great for configuration files Uses indentation to define data structure, similar to how Python structures code. Purposefully made to be easy for humans to read/write Allows commenting YAML Example:  --- # Authors And Books authors: - first_name: Madeleine last_name: L&amp;#39;Engle books: - title: A Wrinkle In Time publisher: Ariel Books genres: - Young Adult - Science Fantasy pages: 218 publish_date: 1962-01-01 description: A Wrinkle in Time is the story of Meg Murry, a high-school-aged girl who is transported on an adventure through time and space with her younger brother Charles Wallace and her friend Calvin O&amp;#39;Keefe to rescue her father, a gifted scientist, from the evil forces that hold him prisoner on another planet.</description>

      <description>TLDR Use ConfigurationBuilder, AddUserSecrets, and IConfiguration.GetValue(&amp;ldquo;key&amp;rdquo;) to get access to User Secrets from any .Net Core project. No complex procedure required! And minimal scarring!*
 *These claims have not been evaluated by any legitimate agency. Read at your own risk.
 Problem &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t push sensitive material to the source code repository.&amp;rdquo;
Most developers are pretty familiar with this. Obviously, we don&amp;rsquo;t want our precious keys and passwords escaping into The Wild Wild Web and falling prey to some nefarious basement dwelling evil-doer named DarkCLIde.</description>

      <description>UPDATES
 06.02.2018: Updated Basic Syntax Differences  @MarkeKraus recently pointed out that I probably missed a good chance to tell you about the differences in case sensitivity between C# and PowerShell. I added a little information in the syntax section that will hopefully help. Thanks, Mark!    Intro So you&amp;rsquo;re a PowerShell-er, but you&amp;rsquo;re interested in doing something with C#? Awesome! I&amp;rsquo;m here to help. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go deep in the weeds in this series, but I&amp;rsquo;m going to see if I can get you from point A to point B with brief explanations inbetween.</description>
